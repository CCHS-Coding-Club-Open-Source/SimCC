CODING CLUB PROJECT: A Full-Fledged SIM-CC
• using Java, for run-time speed
• could share with the school community
Notes 

Everyone needs  java IDE


Everybody needs GitHub

Proposed Starting Time

Those for learning how will we structure

Place for those who Haven’t coded

Coding:
classes: Building, Room, Bathroom, Stairs, Door, Hall, Behavior


Person:
	•	students, teachers, custodians, administrators
	•	Name, location (x,y,z), schedule, age, speed, stressLevel, amountOfSleep, license, car,
	•	Student: 
	•	Student, Teacher, Schedule, etc.
Student: gpa, YOG, motivationLevel, infraction list, disobedience
	•	go to bathroom
	•	Ask a question
	•	Skip class (where do they go)
	•	Leave building
	•	Go towards stairwell
Teacher: strictness, list of favorites (w/ranks), satisfaction level, intensity, ennui, test frequency
Sub inherits from Teacher
Room: # of desks, layout, room number
Floor of building: rooms, the halls, the stairs
Door: open or not
Clubs, sports
Music room - have it play music
Gas valves: fire explodes
Substitutes
Bullying
GUI: for maps and characters and buttons and menus
drawing engine, game engine (or “school engine”), etc.
an interface for editing the building or people, etc.

Person:
	subclass: ScheduledPerson
		subclasses: Teacher, Student
each ScheduledPerson has a Schedule object
each Schedule object has Class objects
each Class object has a Room object

Possible Simulations/Features:
• students moving through the hall at passing time (prevent collisions)
• students interacting with each other, teachers, going to the bathroom and returning, etc.
• moving down the stairs
• dealing with fire alarm
• moving from all rooms to the auditorium 
Part of the point of the simulation would be to analyze constraints of the building and it might be cool to offer alternate possible fire escape paths based on bottlenecks that we see in the code.
• different schedules: MCAS, assembly, etc.
• a variety of buttons and/or key bindings to take actions (pause, fire drill, etc.)
• be able to click on any member of the school community to get info about them
• have a mode that shows real-time classes (if it’s 8:05, it’s Ablock)
• buses to pick kids up at the end of the day
• the parking lot

Challenges: 
• pathfinding algorithm
• ability to zoom in for closer details of rooms (see Aidan N-Z code)
• code to schedule students into their classes
• have characters that move - should face the direction they are moving
• have characters with a specific purpose
• self driving cars in the parking lot

File I/O:
• store in a .csv file (or Serialize): a bunch of info about real teachers and real courses (maybe a few real students - students in coding club?).  


Non-Coding tasks:
• gathering/storing student and school data
• working with school maps
• creating the digital character images
• brainstorm new ideas/features
